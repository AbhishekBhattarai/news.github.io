      <h2>Digital Citizenship</h2>
      <p>A person who is capable of using digital technology to interact with others, take part in society, and produce
        and consume digital information is referred to as a "digital citizen." Digital citizenship is about engaging
        with digital technology in a good and self-assured way. For us to acquire and comprehend digital literacy as
        well as to assure online safety, cybersecurity, digital responsibility, and digital health and well-being,
        digital citizenship education is crucial.

        A person who can productively use digital technology to connect and communicate with others, as well as to
        produce and consume digital information, is referred to as a "digital citizen."
      </p>
      <h3>Nine element of digital world.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Digital Access.</li> <br>
        <img src="/img/digital access.jpg" alt="Digital Access">
        <br>
        <p>It is the full electronic participation in society.
          The capacity to fully engage in a digital society is known as digital access. This includes having access to
          the resources and innovations like the Internet and computers that permit full engagement. Unfortunately, not
          everyone has full access to the internet, which prevents them from fully participating in the digital society.
          The term "Digital Divide" refers to the division between those who have full access and those who do not.
          Digital access comes at many different levels; some people have more and others less. There are several causes
          for the digital divide. These include a lack of financial means to pay for equipment, technology, and Internet
          connectivity; a lack of energy; a lack of knowledge and instruction about using technology; and physical
          barriers to access.
          Users of technology should be conscious that not everyone has access to the same opportunities. Digital
          citizenship begins with promoting access to technology and working for equal digital rights. It is impossible
          to develop as a society that uses these tools more and more when there is digital exclusion. All digital
          citizens should strive to contribute to the creation and expansion of technological access. Users must be
          aware that some of these may have restricted access, necessitating the provision of alternative resources. We
          must be dedicated to ensuring that no one is denied internet access if we want to develop into productive
          citizens.
        </p>
        <h3>For example:</h3>
        <p>As homework, the fifth-grade science students are required to view a 20-minute Discovery Education streaming
          video. They get one week to view the movie online and complete the exam online.
          Even though some students do not have access to the internet and some students who do have access only have
          dial-up connections, the students have been informed that they will earn a zero if they do not view the video
          and complete the exam at home. This is totally unsuitable. due to the fact that not every student has access
          to the internet.
          Instead, the instructor may assign everyone to watch the movie and complete the quiz. He provides the option
          for students who do not have access to the necessary internet connections at home to come to his classroom 30
          minutes before class begins or gives them a CD with the movie and a printed quiz so they may do the
          assignment.
          It's crucial to keep in mind that some students may not have access to the Internet when assigning online
          tasks for them to complete outside of class. Some people may be dealing with a persistent difficulty, while
          others may only be experiencing a brief problem with access. Teachers must provide students alternatives to
          using the Internet since it is such a vital resource for getting the knowledge they need to complete
          assignments.

        </h3>
        <img src="/img/digital communication.png" alt="Digital Communication">
        <p>The capacity of a person to interact with other individuals has undergone one of the fundamental
          transformations brought about by the digital revolution. There were few available channels of communication in
          the 19th century. The number of communication possibilities has increased in the twenty-first century,
          providing a huge range of options (e.g., e-mail, cellular phones, instant messaging). Everything has altered
          as a result of the rising digital communication alternatives since individuals can now stay in continual
          contact with anyone. Now, anyone can communicate and work together with anyone from anywhere at any time.
          Unfortunately, many users lack the knowledge necessary to make wise choices when presented with a wide range
          of digital communication possibilities. <br>
        <h4>For Example:</h4>
        When they realized there was an armed intruder at the middle school earlier in the academic year, parents of
        sixth-grade kids in Ms. Parker's class were scared.
        Since that occurrence, practically all sixth-grade pupils bring their cell phones to school at their parents'
        request so they may reach them in case of any future emergencies. <br>
        <h4>Inappropriate</h4>
        The youngsters are thrilled to get their own own smartphones now. Instead of putting the phone on vibrate or
        turning it off, they chose to set their "unique" ring tones to loud. They pull their phones out as much as
        they can and text their classmates both inside and outside of Mrs. Parker's class. In addition, they snap
        unpleasant pictures of Mrs. Parker and email them to her classmates. <br>
        <h4> Appropriate</h4>
        The topic of cell phones is discussed with the pupils by Mrs. Parker. She acknowledges that their parents want
        them to have phones, but she also reminds them that they should only use them in an emergency and that they
        will be taken away if they are not in backpacks or if the ringtone is heard. She also informs them that her
        principal has asked all instructors to use their personal mobile phones in accordance with the same
        guidelines. <br>

        <h4>What could make a difference?</h4>
        Actually, each of these pupils is in possession of a minicomputer. Just picture what might happen if Mrs.
        Parker started utilizing cell phones as teaching resources.
        Students might send her grammar-related texts. Students may videotape each other practicing speeches using the
        video tools, then watch the recordings to give each other feedback. During math class, students may use the
        calculator's features. Science investigations might be documented via photos taken by students.

          <li>Digital Commerce</li>
        </h3>
        <img src="/img/digital commerce.jpg" alt="Digital Commerce">
        <p>The need to address security concerns associated to using money online is made clear by digital commerce. In
          the classroom, technology is also used to educate students about the various career paths they may select in
          the future. Both as customers and potential business owners, it is imperative that we understand how
          e-commerce operates.
          Users of technology need to be aware that a significant portion of the market economy is conducted
          electronically. Exchanges are legitimate and lawful, but the buyer or seller has to be aware of the problems
          involved. For many users, buying toys, clothes, vehicles, food, and other items through the internet is now
          routine. At the same time, an equal number of products and services that violate certain nations' laws or
          morals are emerging (which might include activities such as illegal downloading, pornography, and gambling).
          Users must learn how to use the new digital economy as effective consumers. <br>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>
          Melissa, who just turned 15, received a $1,000 payment from her wealthy grandma. She used her debit card to
          deposit the cheque into her bank account. Melissa rides with her elder sister to the neighborhood public
          library to use the computer there because her home internet connection is now down. She discovers that eBay
          has just what she's looking for – a brand-new Wii for just $10.00!
        </p>
        <h4>
          Inappropriate
        </h4>
        <p>
          Melissa eagerly pulls out her debit card and places a bid on the object. She is aware of what to do because
          she has seen her father do it before. She rapidly enters her debit card details and chooses $300 as her
          maximum price since she wants to make sure she is the highest bidder. As she exits the library computer, she
          doesn't log off.
        </p>
        <h4>Appropriate</h4>
        <p>
          Melissa understands that a brand-new Wii is not going to sell for for $10. She observes that winning bids have
          often been around $275 when she looks at other Wiis that are up for sale on eBay. She is hesitant to enter her
          debit card information online to buy something for which she is unclear of the ultimate price because she
          truly wants the Wii. She exits the library's computer and leaves for her house.
        </p> <br>
        <h4>
          What could make a difference?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Melissa would be wise to visit a shop that offers Wii and other retail Nintendo goods. She will receive a
          receipt so she may return the new item if it doesn't function as intended and she will know the precise cost
          of the item she is buying.
          Since her debit card is the "key" to her checking account funds, her parents and instructors would be wise to
          remind her to take caution when using it.

          <li>Digital literacy</li>
        </h3>
        <img src="/img/Digital literacy.webp" alt="Digital literacy">
        <p>Another component of digital literacy that might negatively impact your kids' lives is knowing how to tell
          the difference between real and fake content. Kids need to know what knowledge is helpful to them and what
          they should avoid in order to have a healthy life.
          Although technological integration in schools has advanced greatly, much work has to be done. Refocusing on
          what should be taught about technology and how to use it is necessary. New technologies that are not utilized
          in classrooms are making their way into the workplace (Videoconferencing, online sharing spaces such as
          wikis). Additionally, people in a variety of professions want quick information (just-in-time information).
          This method calls for in-depth searching and processing abilities (i.e., information literacy). It's important
          to teach students how to learn in a digital age. In other words, teachers need to teach students how to learn
          anything, anywhere, at any time. Excellent instances of how technology is employed differently in the 21st
          century may be found in business, the military, and medical.
          Learners must be able to pick up new technologies fast and utilize them responsibly. People who are involved
          in digital citizenship education must have a high level of information literacy.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>The task of writing a report on an endangered species has been given to the pupils in Ms. Rubin's class. When
          Ellen searches for endangered animals on Google, she finds a story on the "Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus."
          She is eager to learn more about this animal because she has never heard of it. She settles on her topic for
          her investigation based on this one webpage.</p>
        <h4>In appropriate:</h4>
        <p>From this one source, Ellen gathers information on the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus. She doesn't consult
          any further sources to verify the data she has discovered. She launches her own campaign to raise awareness of
          this threatened species and money to help rescue the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus since she is so passionate
          about it.</p>
        <h4>Appropriate</h4>
        <p>Ms. Rubin would be wise to explain to her students that not everything they read online is factual. To assess
          the reliability of information they get online, students should learn to examine a variety of sources.
          Students might utilize a checklist of indicators to confirm the veracity of the material on a website.</p>
        <h4>What could make a difference?</h4>
        <p>The instructor should really conduct a session where students are directed to fictitious websites and asked
          to report back on their findings before starting a research unit. This would then spark a conversation about
          how to determine if a digital source is trustworthy. Students may improve their critical thinking skills by
          using websites like The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus, Save the Mountain Walrus, GenoChoicr, and The
          Sellafield Zoo to distinguish between reliable and false online material.</p>

          <li>Digital Etiquette</li>

        </h3>
        <img src="/img/Digital Etiquette.png" alt="Digital Etiquette">

        <p>We should train pupils to become “digitally fluent”. Their online conduct is shaped by digital etiquette so
          that they can engage with online information favorably. This reflects their attitude both online and off, and
          vice versa.
          Users of technology frequently view this issue as one of the most urgent ones when it comes to Digital
          Citizenship. We can spot incorrect behavior when we see it, but people seldom acquire digital manners before
          using technology (i.e., appropriate conduct). Many people find it awkward to discuss their online conduct with
          other people. To prevent unlawful usage, laws and restrictions are frequently made, or the technology is
          outright forbidden. Making norms and policies is not enough; we also need to educate everyone on how to act
          responsibly in this new digital society.
        </p>
        <h4>For example</h4>
        <p>A frustrated parent whose child was not accepted into the gifted program emails the talented instructor with
          inquiries about the rejection. The mom sends a last email to the instructor after exchanging multiple emails
          with the teacher in which she vents her frustration over the fact that her very intelligent child is not
          accepted despite her protests. Many of the lines in this last email are in all capitals, and it closes with
          "WTF."
        <h4>

          Inappropriate:
        </h4>
        The instructor sends an immediately irate email in response to learning what the letters "WTF" stand for.
        Additionally, she uses a lot of caps lock in her email, which concludes with the warning "don't send me any
        more emails or I will have you prosecuted with harassment."
        <h4>

          Appropriate:
        </h4>
        The instructor phoned the parent when the second round of emails began. The educator patiently listened to the
        parent's concerns and made an effort to provide emotion-free answers. The instructor alerted the administrator
        and requested that she meet with the parent about this matter when the parent continued to send irate emails
        following the phone call.
        <h4>

          What could make a difference
        </h4>
        In staff development sessions or during faculty meetings, the topic of digital etiquette must be covered.
        Teachers have some influence over how they should reply, but they have no control over what a parent writes in
        an email. A few things to remember are to never react in a hurry, never write anything down that you wouldn't
        say in person, and always bear in mind that whatever you send over email may be retrieved at a later time.

          <li>Digital Law</li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Both good and bad interactions are possible in the online realm. The legal rights and limitations governing
          the use of technology are the subject of digital law. Students must understand the law and how it pertains to
          them specifically in order to prevent any type of online crime, no matter how serious.

          The ethics of technology within a society are addressed by digital law. The result of unethical use is theft
          and/or criminal activity. Observing social norms is one way that ethical use is expressed. Users must be aware
          that it is illegal to steal or harm another person's work, identity, or property online. In a culture that
          values ethics, users must be aware of certain social norms. Anyone who works or plays online must abide by
          these laws. It is immoral to hack into other people's data, download unlawful music, plagiarize, create Trojan
          Horses or damaging worms, distribute spam, or steal someone's identity or property.
        <h4>

          For example:
        </h4>
        5th grade teacher Mr. Gilbert is utilizing the online video creation tool Animoto to compile a collection of
        student images into a movie. The teacher wants the movie's background music to be recognizable by the kids,
        despite the fact that the Animoto website offers non-copyrighted music. None of the music offered on this
        website will sound familiar to the kids. <br>

        <h4>

          Inappropriate:
        </h4>

        The son of Mr. Gilbert has a Chris Brown CD. He chooses to use it as the soundtrack for the film and download
        the song "With You." He is aware of the kids' love for this song and that they would appreciate the movie much
        more if they can sing along to the soundtrack. Once he has finished making his video, he submits it to his
        teacher's website.
        <h4>

          Appropriate
        </h4>
        Animoto is a free website for creating movies out of a collection of images. It's fortunate that Mr. Gilbert
        is aware of our website. On their website, a disclaimer instructs customers to either select the
        copyright-free music they have there or any other music they have obtained formal permission to use. Mr.
        Gilbert takes that counsel to heart and uses the Animoto website's music.
        <h4>

          What could make a difference?
        </h4>

        There could be pupils who can play an instrument and have written their own music or who can perform music
        that is in the public domain as the movie's background music.
        Teachers need to be aware that copyright laws still apply to them even when they are working on educational
        projects. Many instructors have the misperception that they may use digital media for anything as long as it
        is instructional.

          Users have rights and obligations in the online environment, which is governed by rules. Anyone requires
          protection from negative uses of the Internet, such as cyberbullying, which can take many forms. This

          Digital citizens are entitled to freedom of expression, privacy, etc. In the digital age, fundamental
          digital rights must be addressed, covered, and comprehended. These privileges come with responsibilities
          as
          well. The proper usage of the technology must be determined with the assistance of the users. These two

        <h4>

          For example
        </h4>
        Fourth-grade teacher Mrs. Walker is starting a brand-new American Revolution topic with her class. She makes
        a stunning PowerPoint presentation and includes images of well-known figures and locations from that era.
        She used Google image search to find these images.

        <h4>

          Inappropriate
        </h4>

        While "wonderful," Mrs. Walker's PowerPoint presentation does not credit the photographer who provided the
        images. She does have a slide that states, "Photos got from Google," but she hasn't given credit to each
        photo's unique source since she is unaware that there is one. She believes that all of these pictures are
        posted by Google.
        <h4>

          Appropriate
        </h4>

        The photographs that Mrs. Walker obtained from other websites allowed her to create her "wonderful"
        PowerPoint presentation. At the bottom of each image she adds to the PowerPoint, she credits the
        photographer. Additionally, she emphasizes this to her students.
        <h4>

          What could make a difference?
        </h4>
        Students will imitate their professors' behavior. If a teacher wants her students to credit sources, she
        must use the same procedure for all forms of media (print, digital, and audio) that she employs in the
        classroom. Teachers should receive training on search engines and how to find photos meant for instructional
        use.

        <p>
          The importance of protecting oneself and others from harm and of seeking assistance when necessary should be
          taught in students. Utilizing internet resources is advantageous, but everyone needs to be aware of the risks
          as well. <br>

          There are persons that steal from, vandalize, or disturb other people in every culture. The online community
          can be said to be similar. For our personal protection, it is not enough to rely on our neighbors. To ensure
          some amount of security in our own homes, we install locks on the doors and fire alarms. The digital security
          must be the same. We require virus protection, data backups, and surge protection for our equipment. We must
          safeguard our information from outside influences that can disrupt it or harm it as responsible citizens.
        <h4>

          Example:

        </h4>
        The elementary school students are eager to use the computers. They have to crane their necks to look up at
        the computer screen if they sit in the seats. When using the computers, some students have started to

        The tables in the classroom have been lowered to allow the kids to comfortably view the computer screen. With
        remote keyboards, kids may type while sitting down on the keyboards.

        Occasionally, finding "child-size" furniture might be challenging. Computers are not just made for adult
        hands, but tables and chairs that can hold computer equipment are frequently made for adults as well. Wouldn't
        it be fantastic if someone created computer furniture that was made for a young learner, preventing any bad
        posture problems from computer use.

        Security in the online world is important. When using devices at school or at home, students should be aware of
        potential malware attacks. Teachers should explain how to prevent them from happening and how to protect their
        devices as much as possible.
        <h4>

          For example:
        </h4>
        Ms. Perlman receives an email from an unknown sender. She clicks on the attachment in the email message. The
        document's filename is "dancing pigs." She feels like she could use a nice chuckle after having such a difficult
        day. The add-on "dancing pigs" may be amusing.
        <h4>

          Inappropriate:
        </h4>
        The email is opened by Ms. Perlman. When she does, her computer begins acting strangely and eventually crashes
        after five minutes.
        Ms. Perlman detects a problem with her computer and rushes to inform the school's technology coordinator.
        <h4>
          Appropriate:

        </h4>
        When Ms. Perlman opens the email, she discovers that she is unfamiliar with the sender. She recalls being
        cautioned against opening email attachments from unknown senders. She deletes the message without even reading
        the attachment, despite the intriguing-sounding attachment title. She keeps going through her email.

        <h4>

          What could make a difference?
        </h4>
        The importance of digital security concerns, even something as basic as opening attachments from unknown
        sources, should be emphasized to teachers frequently. Teachers must be reminded that even though school
        computers are equipped with several virus detection tools and firewalls, they should still use caution and good
        judgment.
